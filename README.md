# Introduction

This project is a **Power BI dashboard** designed to analyze **call center performance and operations**. It provides an interactive and connected view of the data across multiple pages, including **Home Page**, **Call Volume & Performance**, **Employee & Site Analysis**, and **Financial Overview**.

All pages are fully **interactive and interconnected**, allowing dynamic exploration of key metrics and insights. This project showcases my ability to **understand business data**, design **clear analytical dashboards**, and effectively use **Power BI** for data modeling, visualization, and insight generation.
